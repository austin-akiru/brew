# Brew 2: Cardamom Bitter

An attempt to add a bit of a surprise to a standard bitter.



## Brew Day 17/3/19

- Heat 10l of water to 70C
- Add 100g of crushed chocolate malt and steep for 30 minutes. 
- Mix 1kg of light malt to some water and add, boil for an hour
- Added 10g of alpha acid hops at start, put them in a bag to stop them clogging the tap at the end. 
- *4 seems to be a good dual for rolling boil, if the lid is not clicked down.* 
- 5 minutes before end of boil add 2g of hops and 5g of cardamom. 
- OG 10.30
- Transfer to fermentation bucket, keeping a bit for hydrometer test. 
- Put bucket in sink and run cold water over it to cool. 
- Pitch the yeast with some sugar and warm water when the bucket was down to 45C
- Got bored and put the foaming yeast in the bucket at 35C and put in cupboard. 

## Barrel Day 24/3/19

- Forgot to check final gravity. I think it was about 2.8%. 
- Barrelled then left in garage for a month.

## Tasting Day 27/4/19

- It was quite nice. 
- Reviews were encouraging.
- Cardamom taste was thin.
- Beer was quite light.

## Lessons Learnt

- Cooling is important. Meant to do it rapidly. putting it in the sink and running cold water over it seems reasonably fast. Must transfer from boiler to fermenter first!
- A heat exchanger would be even faster.
- Need to remember to take hydrometer readings from fermenter at start and end of brew. This would be easier with a Tilt Hydrometer: [https://tilthydrometer.com](https://tilthydrometer.com/)
- Donâ€™t be stingy on the malt.
