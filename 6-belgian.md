# Belgian Triple

Still keen to explore more styles, this time Iâ€™m leaning towards my favourite brewing country, Belgium. As itâ€™s still summer Iâ€™m looking for something lighter, so a triple seems like a good place to start. Plus theyâ€™re nice and strong.



## Ingredients

- 10.5L water
- 1.5Kg light malt extract
- 750g pilzner malt
- 25g Saaz hops

2. Add 10.5l water to boiler with 1 tbsp Camden powder.
3. Raise to 65C
4. Drink a Pannepot Special Reserve while waiting.
5. Turn thermostat down to 1.5 to maintain 65C
6. Add 750g pilzner malt in malt mag. Steep for 30 minutes.

## Making candi sugar

This was doing using a recipe from [homebrewforum](https://www.thehomebrewforum.co.uk/threads/how-to-make-belgian-candi-syrup.12754/).

1. Add 1kg golden caster sugar to clean pan.
2. Add just enough warm water to dissolve.
3. Add 1 tbsp citric acid.
4. Raise to between 125C and 135C.
5. Maintain temperature for >20 minutes until rich colour.
6. Add tbsp of water to control temperature.
7. Add to boiler at correct time whilst still hot.

## Tilt

Iâ€™ve used a TiltPi with the tilt hydrometer through this process. Being able to monitor my brew gravity and temperature remotely is very useful. It also allows me to draw graphs.

## Labels

Iâ€™ve been upgrading the bottle design, with thanks to Mic. Iâ€™ve also aligned this blog, adding to untappd and label printing so they all tie to each other.

## Bottling Day, 16/9/20

- Fermentation slowed down, still breathing but gravity levelled off at 1.010
- This gives an final ABV of 7.7%
- Filled 10 bottles with bottling wand and sediment trap.
- added 1/2 tbsp golden caster sugar for priming
- Left half the liquid in fermenter for beer experiment
- Added a handful of chopped coriander and peel of an orange to give a seasonal flavour.
- Left for a week to see how fermentation continues.

## Barrelling Day, 24/9/20

- Clean barrel and piping
- Cyphon beer into pressure barrel
- Seal
- Add CO2

## Tasting Notes

- Bottles look professional
- Beer tastes like a Belgian Triple ðŸ™‚
- It could do with chilling to add an extra layer of crispness.
- Beer is lively.
- Tastes fine after 2 weeks, but will try aging for >1 month to see how it improves. 

## Lessons Learnt

- Brewing in the kitchen is more comfortable. More space, more music, more comfortable.
- Drinking whilst brewing is inspiring, and not at all dangerous.
- Make sure boiler plug is dry before plugging in.
- Bottling wand makes bottling so much easier.
- Easier to make QR codes with [https://www.qrcode-monkey.com](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)
- I need to make a nicer looking graph next time
