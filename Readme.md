# A new era

As I’ve finally decided to move away from modifying brew brew kits and start brewing with real ingredients, I have decided to keep a diary of recipes and other things that I will (hopefully) learn along the way.

The diary used to exist in rough notes on my phone, but I’m finally translating it to a blog.

## Beer Ideas

Random thoughts of interesting beers. If only I knew how to make them…

* Blueberry Berliner Weisse
  * Find out how to make one. Add blueberrys to make it blue. Add lactose to make it creamy. 

* Dog Beer
  * Very weak bitter. Add chicken. Apparnetly this alredy exists.

* Darth Vader Juice
  * It’s an Imperial Stout. Liquorice, Belgian candy sugar. Belgian yeast. Lactose. Chocolate malt. Lots of malt.
